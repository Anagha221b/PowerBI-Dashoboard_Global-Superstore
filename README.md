# PowerBI-Dashoboard_Global-Superstore
Global Superstore Data analyzing. The reason for analyzing data to know sales trends and which category, country, product that made more sales also know what is in the data if there are any anomalies and forecast sales to predict what the future brings for us.
I've created an impactful dashboard using the Global Superstore dataset. Here's an overview of the steps I covered: 1️⃣ Connected the database with Power BI Desktop, seamlessly integrating the data. 2️⃣ Analyzed tables and established meaningful relationships to unlock deep insights. 3️⃣ Conducted comprehensive data cleaning using Power Query Editor and harnessed the power of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to ensure utmost accuracy. 4️⃣ Developed an interactive BI dashboard/report that breathes life into the data, empowering informed decision-making. In the dashboard, I focused on key metrics such as sales, quantity, average delivery days, and identified top-profit and loss customers. Additionally, I created visualizations to showcase the sum of sales by market and segment, and leveraged a map to explore sales by region. To enhance the user experience, I also included a year slicer for dynamic analysis.
